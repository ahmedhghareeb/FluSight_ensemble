# Flu_Ensemble
This repository will be used to develop an ensemble forecast based on submissions to the CDC's FluSight Influenza Forecasting Challenge. The purpose of the ensemble is to take advantage of the multiple forecasts being submitted to CDC and develop an improved model by combining information from those forecasts. All data and code in the repository are publically contributed by the participants. Please note that any data or code posted here, or any forecasts generated as a result, are not official CDC forecasts and are not endorsed by the CDC.

## FluSight Influenza Forecasting Challenge
Since 2013, the Influenza Division at CDC has worked with external researchers to help advance the science of influenza forecasting by sponsoring an annual competition to most accurately predict the upcoming flu season. This year's challenge will begin on November 7, 2016, and updated forecasts will be posted on the [FluSight](https://predict.phiresearchlab.org/flu/index.html) website weekly. More detailed information can be found at the website, or in the [guidelines and submission template](https://github.com/cdcepi/flu_ensemble/tree/master/Challenge_Documents) for this year's challenge.
