# Flu_Ensemble
This repository will be used to develop an ensemble forecast based on submissions to the CDC's FluSight Influenza Forecasting Challenge. All data and code in the repository are publically contributed by the participants. 

## FluSight Influenza Forecasting Challenge
Since 2013, the Influenza Division at CDC has worked with external researchers to help advance the science of influenza forecasting by sponsoring an annual competition to most accurately predict the upcoming flu season. This year's challenge will begin on November 7, 2016, and updated forecasts will be posted on the [FluSight](https://predict.phiresearchlab.org/flu/index.html) website weekly. More detailed information can be found at the website, or in the [guidelines and submission template](https://github.com/cdcepi/flu_ensemble/tree/master/Challenge_Documents) for this year's challenge.
